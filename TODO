as fast as possible:
#############################

* [DONE] opening of file leads to two instances of the module sometimes
* [DONE] code cleanup concerning module-scanning and module-initialization (for usage with any module, not only 'synDiaEBNF')
* [DONE] synDiaEBNF: wizard starts, when file is opened
* [DONE] buttons of module don't disappear when module is closed by the user
* special characters don't work on all platforms (esp. not an solaris) --> view /doc/character-problem
* solaris: while creating syntactical diagram with the mouse, it is not displayed (only if you press zoom in/out)
* [DONE] bug in backtracking algorithms: work not for concatenations in lower part of repetition
* [mostly DONE] remove try-catch blocks for e.g. Nullpointerexceptions to make debugging possible
* there are empty catch blocks, handle these exceptions
* mac os x: gui works only after resizing the main window at least one time
* mac os x: "Fertigstellen"-button after creation of an ebnf-definition does nothing
* mac os x: while creating syntactical diagram with the mouse, it is not displayed (only if you press zoom in/out)  - same bug with solaris
* [DONE] bug in trans-algorithm: nullpointer exception when trying to transform something like S={{{abc}}}
* bug in Backtrack-Algo: if breaked and started new, it remembers the old state! (ben)
* Wizard: at "Neue EBNF" -> "neue EBNF-Definition der Form...." afterwards the Text is missing (ben)
* bug in Backtrack-Algo: when I go a little bit forward and backward in 2 SynDias I get a wrong Label in the stack and have and endless loop (ben)

medium:
#############################

* improve usability
* file name of opened file is not displayed
* swt-actions, images, etc. for modules are in org.jalgo.main.*  (should be in org.jalgo.module... )
* printing for linux/solaris (depends on gtk)
* translation into English
* trans()-algorithm "backwards"
* improve i18n identical strings should be writen once not 3 or 4 times....
* remove duplicated code
* split translated Strings in 2 portions. Mainprog. and Module
* [DONE] remove magic numbers, replace them with describing constant names
* port to SWT 3
* implement NewModuleAction.java
* Info Field: Ordering the authors after who is most active (ben)
* Info Field: Link to TU-Dresden + TU-Logo (ben)
* BacktrackAlgo: show the current position when at Alternative (ben)
* there are 4 Algorithm Buttons for 2 Algorithms (ben)
* lock the History Buttons in the Overview, after using the Algo (ben)
* the Warning Window has to be a Dialog Window (as the Questions) (ben)
* save Syntax Diagramm (ben)
* flip the Stack (so that it goes from bottom to top) (ben)
* add the Name of the Author in the TODOs and FIXMEs so that anyone can ask what went wrong (ben)
* don't waste the std-Output or don't create the error.log. Only one from both (ben)

larger projects:
#############################

* new modules for other algorithms (trees, sorting, transformation C0 -> AM0, graph algorithms, ...)
