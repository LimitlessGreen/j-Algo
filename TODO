as fast as possible:
#############################

* [DONE] opening of file leads to two instances of the module sometimes
* [DONE] code cleanup concerning module-scanning and module-initialization (for usage with any module, not only 'synDiaEBNF')
* [DONE] synDiaEBNF: wizard starts, when file is opened
* buttons of module don't disappear when module is closed by the user
* special characters don't work on all platforms (esp. not an solaris)
* solaris: while creating syntactical diagram with the mouse, it is not displayed (only if you press zoom in/out)
* bug in backtracking algorithms: work not for concatenations in lower part of repetition
* [mostly DONE] remove try-catch blocks for e.g. Nullpointerexceptions to make debugging possible
* there are empty catch blocks, handle these exceptions


medium:
#############################

* improve usability
* file name of opened file is not displayed
* swt-actions, images, etc. for modules are in org.jalgo.main.*  (should be in org.jalgo.module... )
* printing for linux/solaris (depends on gtk)
* translation into English
* trans()-algorithm "backwards"
* improve i18n identical strings should be writen once not 3 or 4 times....
* remove duplicated code
* split translated Strings in 2 portions. Mainprog. and Module


larger projects:
#############################

* new modules for other algorithms (trees, sorting, transformation C0 -> AM0, graph algorithms, ...)
