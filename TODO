#############################

* special characters don't work on all platforms (esp. not an solaris) --> view /doc/character-problem

* mac os x, solaris: while creating syntactical diagram with the mouse, it is not displayed (only if you press zoom in/out)
* bug in Backtrack-Algo: if breaked and started new, it remembers the old state! (ben)
* bug in Backtrack-Algo: when I go a little bit forward and backward in 2 SynDias I get a wrong Label in the stack and have and endless loop (ben)
* add a delete button for editing syntactical diagrams (Stephan)
* port to SWT 3 (Stephan)
